# SUM THE STRINGS

### Challenge

Create a function that takes 2 positive integers in form of a string as an input, and outputs the sum (also as a string):

  sum_str("4", "5")    # should output "9"
  sum_str("34", "5")   # should output "39"
  
If the value entered is empty, it should be converted to 0
