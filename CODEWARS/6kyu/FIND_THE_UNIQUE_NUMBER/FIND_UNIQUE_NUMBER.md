# FIND the UNIQUE NUMBER

### Challenge

There is an array with some numbers. All numbers are equal except for one. Try to find it!

find_unique([ 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1 ]) == 2
find_unique([ 0, 0, 0.55, 0, 0 ]) == 0.55

It’s guaranteed that array contains at least 3 numbers.

The tests contain some very huge arrays, so think about performance.

This is the first kata in series:

    Find the unique number (this kata)
    Find the unique string
    Find The Unique
